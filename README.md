# ChromiumWebBrowser
 Fully working C# webbrowser
 
 This has been my main project for a past year or two.
 
 This webbrowser has all features you expect.(basic bookmarks,settings,cookie support, etc.)
 
 It has its flaws but for a first c# winform project i think i did good.
 
 Packages needed:
 
                 cef.redist.x64.3.3578.1863
                 cef.redist.x86.3.3578.1863
                 CefSharp.Common.71.0.0
                 CefSharp.WinForms.71.0.0
