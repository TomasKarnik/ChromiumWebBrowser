# ChromiumWebBrowser
 Fully working C# webbrowser
 
 This has been my main project for a past year or two.
 
 This webbrowser has all features you expect:
  -basic bookmarks
  -settings
  -cookies
  -downloading, etc.
 
 It has its flaws.
 
 How to use:
  Download from github. 
  
  Open chromium3.sln
  
  Install following packages from NuGet. 
  
  It will propably auto-detest packages needed , just click "Restore" if it shows up
  
  If you cant restore, install packages bellow. 
  
  Choose most recent option its propably same as version used in this project. 
  
  I try to keep it up-to-date.
